---Country---
Rakes live in a country known as Raktorve, Which is a country on earth,
Raktorve is big, it's the size of the USA, But slightly bigger
while also being very friendly together, and have a slight chance to let people inside their homeland called Raktorve,
Raktorve has been villainized by the humans because of humans trying to forcefully get in, But end up dying.
The reason why that is, The people keep trying to kill them all because of the past, And also because they eat humans too, The past is when the rakes didn't have a country and hunted for food, Raktorve started with a small gang, called The Rektontorems, and killed thousands of humans trying to level up their small gang.
they killed and shared food, and were less hostile to humans back then,
The gang grew so big that it transformed into a country, it was called The Rake Republic,
Again gaining more and more rakes to the point where they voted to give the country an official name once they reached around 25 thousand rakes.


Raktorve's Flag:
 
 
 


The Raktorve Flag may not show in plain text or text to speech, In order to view the flag, You must view it from the original documentation txt file, Using the old wordpad, Or the folder with the documentation, Otherwise please download the original folder to view it.


Raktorve is pronounced Rack-Torv

Rack. Torv.

Rack, Torv.

R, a, c, k. T, o, r. V.

Rak Torve.

Many text to speeches cannot read the word Raktorve correctly, There may be a chance you're using a text to speech.

When Raktorve loses to a war or has to call in backup, They launch a VERY aggressive group of rakes, Called the RRR (Reprehensible Rogue Rakes).
Image:
 
The image may be pixelated just a little bit because of how powerful and the energy auras around them are.

This image will not show up in any other format or app excluding wordpad.

They have their own country named Ravitxorvion, This country is a backup of Raktorve, When the rakes lose to a war, Or need backup, They use a teleportation device to teleport Raktorve into a dimensional pocket datastore, It manipulates reality, Teleporting the whole country of Raktorve into a datastore outside of reality, When the datastore is accessed, It restores Raktorve and places it back into reality, You may wonder what happens to the chunk taken out of the earth when Raktorve is stored, The datastore will automatically put normal land there, Like grass and stone to replace that chunk, Like nothing happened! Anyways, Ravitxorvion is as far as the miles located from the earth to the moon. Ravitxorvion stores MUCH MORE WEAPONS than Raktorve, Since all the weapons in Raktorve to defend the country is located at the border, That's not much, Because inside the cities, There is no form of defense like at the borders, That makes it a little vulnerable, But, The weapons are 25x more powerful than the USA's. The only difference between Ravitxorvion and Raktorve is that Ravitxorvion's population is equal to 2.5 BILLION RABID RAKES! These rakes are only the most aggressive to humans, But not a single bit aggressive to rakes, Ravitxorvion is full of guns and weapons, 500000x stronger than Raktorve's.

---Religion---
Rakes believe in what the Jewish religion believes.
Rakes pray to god occasionally to get accepted into heaven,
and might actually have a good chance of getting into heaven, although most of them do not.
Rakes love to pray and follow their God's rules, God grants rakes this technology because of many prayers, i'm kind of surprised how God hasn't let the rakes obliterate us. Oh and if you're anything else other than noahide or jewish go fuh- wait i can't say that here because people will get mad at me. Not worth for being such a beach to an innocent kid wait i meant brat okay not not that okay dont shame me ok im sorry ok..

---Reasons For Rakes---
Rakes kill things because it sees it as an entity that may hurt the rake,
This is because rakes used to trust other species and entities, but after war..

---Rake Population---
Rakes have a really big population, The exact population is a record breaking.. 26 BILLION RAKE POPULATION!
You may be wondering.. How can 26 billion rakes fit in a country slightly bigger than the usa? Well, Rakes use a VERY advanced technology that allows pocket dimensions to be created, So basically, Raktorve is a pocket dimension.


---Rake Victims---
No. The rakes aren't victims, Rakes have their own victims, For TGGOAR (The Great Guardian Of All Rakes) has over 20 million victims, The victims are killed in a time range for 2 hours - 2 days in time of the victim's time to live, The rake's victims are humans, Obviously for food.


---Rake Language---
Rakes can speak 4 languages, Revtorkai, Rakish, Voynich Manuscript, And English. Rakish, And Revtorkai's language has their own symbols while speaking, Here are them all:
⨕.
⨋.
⨙.
⨃.
ʫ.
◊.
⨑.
⨷.
⩸.
⪿.
ϗ.

Now for the symbols of Revtorkai:
¶.
‽.
⏕.
ʩ.
ʢ.
ʑ.
◬.
◘.
ↈ.
∊.
≁. 

That's the end of symbols. It takes atleast 27 years to speak Rakish, But 63 years to speak Revtorkai, But it takes 6 months for Rakes to learn Raktorkai, And 1 month to learn Rakish. But you may be wondering, What about the Voynich Manuscript? The Voynich Manuscript has not yet been decoded and it may take 250+ years to learn, But all we know is that Rakes speak Voynich Manuscript as a secret language to communicate without the humans ever knowing. You may search up the Voynich Manuscript to see what it is.


---Features Of Rakes---
Rakes are obviously different than humans, Rakes have a lot of special features too, So here are them listed.

Rake's eyes have a bright white glow to them, Letting rakes see in the dark.

When rakes are hurt badly, They have a chance to trigger Blood hour, Or nightmare hour. Hours are triggered modes when rake is hurt bad and triggers a hour, Blood Hour is a common hour that lasts 1 minute and turns fog extremely red when active. Before the Hour begins, The Rake will go into its crouching position and slowly transition.

Hours are special events that can happen in-game. They can be triggered by The Rake usually with luck or hurting rake without intent of defense, It turns the fog into the color of the hour, Rake's speed, Damage, And notice distance is increased majorly, Depending on how strong the hour is.



---Places You Can Find Rakes---
You can find rakes either outside or inside Raktorve,
In raktorve, You can find rakes pretty much everywhere, It's like japan, The city sidewalks are filled with hovercars flying everywhere, With many towers up in the sky, With about 500 rakes per city block, Think about it as miles, There are almost 1 thousand rakes per mile, The cities are kind of flooded, There are A LOT LOT of cars in the cities, There are many trucks full of rakes sitting in the back, The cities are huge! The cities strech 70 miles per city! But meanwhile outside Raktorve, You'll find rakes in forests, And caves, You'll see people with hoodies walking around, With many layers of clothing, That may be a rake, They live in unoccupied areas, They can also set up square tents around the forest, You can only find rakes occasionally.


---Pollution With Rakes---
Rakes have so many cities, You may be wondering.. How much pollution do the rakes make? Well, The answer to that question is not what you might think, You see, Raktorve's border uses a magnetic field, And it will catch pollution, And deconstruct it's atoms, But what about inside the cities where rakes are? In almost all of the cities in Raktorve, There are outlets, And there are plugged in "Attractors", They look like portable plasma balls, It uses gravity manipulation to attract dust and pollution, It filters it out and deconstructs it's atoms, Leaving nothing behind.

The real answer is none, They do not spread pollution.


---Future Plans From Rakes---

This event will happen around when WW3 happens, Raktorve will be involved inside this war, But not just that war, Several other countries like Zambia, North Korea, Mongol Empire, And Russia will attack at Raktorve, And Raktorve has a high chance of winning this war, If not, The rakes will launch backup, Formerly known as RRR, And will escape to Ravitxorvion too.

Which is the last time this documentation info part was updated. It's also a hitman hired by TGGOAR, It's just as deadly as John Wick (reference to something familiar hehehehehe..) And is 24 years old.


---Rake's Coding---
Rakes use a coding language known as Lisp, Lisp is a programming language that is one of the oldest. It is still used to this day to work on several high-level artificial intelligence applications (AI). It is similar to Java, C and C++.
Rakes also use coding languages known as Haskell, Malbolge, And much more, Such as PHP, And Whitespace.


---Rake Technology Utilization---
When they say Rakes have hover cars and how they can fly around, You ask how it works, But they don't know, They're just civillians of Raktorve's cities.

Here's how they work.

1. Hovercars
As this is the thing you really want to know about (Probably), Here's how they work.

They use ultrasound transducers to levitate off the ground, That's why they make a lot of noises as the engine is used. Think of using vibrations to lift an object. That's how hovercars work.
